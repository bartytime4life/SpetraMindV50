Each command accepts a --config flag pointing to a Hydra configuration
file and supports overrides for individual parameters.  Rich progress bars
(via tqdm or rich) provide feedback during long operations.  The CLI
defaults to quiet logging but can be made verbose with -v flags.

17. User interface and dashboards

For interactive exploration and monitoring, the project includes several
user interfaces:
	1.	Jupyter notebooks and lab – Notebooks under notebooks/ illustrate
data inspection, feature visualisation and model interpretation.  They
rely on the same underlying modules as the CLI to ensure consistency.
	2.	MLOps dashboard – A web dashboard (e.g., built with Streamlit or
Dash) displays experiment results, hyperparameter search progress and
retrieval spectra.  Users can compare models, inspect logs and view
uncertainty bands.  This dashboard is optional and disabled by default
for environments without a GUI.
	3.	Reporting – Automated report generators produce PDF or Markdown
summaries of each experiment.  These reports include plots, tables and
textual interpretations and are stored in the reports/ directory.

18. Security, access control and compliance

Although the challenge datasets are simulated and public, security and
compliance considerations still apply:
	1.	Access control – API endpoints and dashboards require authentication
tokens to prevent unauthorised access.  Sensitive configuration files
(e.g., credentials for object storage) are stored via environment
variables or secret managers.
	2.	Data privacy – When integrating user‑supplied or proprietary data,
we follow GDPR and local regulations.  Personal data is never stored in
logs.  Data at rest and in transit are encrypted when necessary.
	3.	Supply‑chain security – Dependencies are pinned, and packages are
scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., using pip-audit).  Build pipelines
verify checksums of downloaded archives.
	4.	Compliance – All software licences are documented.  Third‑party
models or datasets are used in accordance with their licences.

19. Extensibility and future work

SpectraMind V50 is designed to evolve beyond the 2025 challenge.  Future
directions include:
	1.	Multi‑instrument integration – Incorporating data from other
telescopes (e.g., JWST, HST, ground‑based observatories) to perform
joint retrievals and cross‑validation.
	2.	Active learning and simulation – Using model uncertainty to propose
new simulations or observations that maximise information gain.  This
can guide telescope scheduling or synthetic data generation.
	3.	Physics‑informed deep learning – Further integration of
differentiable physics and neural networks to speed up retrievals while
maintaining physical fidelity.
	4.	Real‑time processing – Adapting the pipeline for real missions,
enabling near real‑time feedback during observations (e.g., to adjust
exposure times).  This requires optimisation and potentially porting
modules to CUDA or FPGA accelerators.
	5.	Community extensions – Encouraging contributions from the
astrophysics and ML communities.  Contribution guidelines specify code
standards, documentation and testing requirements.

This document consolidates the architecture for SpectraMind V50 and outlines
how data flow from raw files through calibration, extraction, modelling and
reporting.  By following these guidelines, the project seeks not only to
perform well in the NeurIPS 2025 Ariel Data Challenge but also to set a
standard for reproducible, scalable and scientifically grounded data
pipelines in exoplanet research.
