## 1) Overview & Principles

### 1.1 Scope & Audience

This hub serves engineers, scientists, and contributors building SpectraMind V50. It covers scientific fundamentals, reproducibility, modeling best practices, GUI engineering for dashboards, and Ariel mission knowledge—curated as the reference layer for coding, experimentation, and operations.

### 1.2 Reproducibility Contract (Science‑first)

We enforce a strict documentation‑first approach: every experiment, pipeline, and diagnostic is tied to templates, model cards, and versioned configs. This ensures auditability, credibility, and repeatability across environments and timelines.

### 1.3 How to Use this Docs Hub

* Read the **Scientific Method & Templates** first, then consult **Modeling** and **Physics/Astrophysics** for theory.
* Use **GUI Engineering** when building dashboards/tools.
* Reference **Ariel Mission** for domain context and instrumentation constraints.
* Follow **Domain Module Examples** for reproducible experiments and model documentation.

---

## 2) Scientific Method, Experimentation & Templates

* **Universal Experiment Template** — A standardized, domain‑agnostic template for problem, hypothesis, method, parameters, data sources, results, analysis, and conclusions.
* **Coding Project Templates** — Production‑grade templates for `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and **Model Cards** capturing intended use, data, performance, and limitations.
* **Glossary** — Shared terminology to avoid ambiguity across AI, physics, and engineering subdomains.

*Files:*

* `Foundational Templates and Glossary for Scientific Method / Research / Master Coder Protocol.pdf`
* `Scientific Method _ Research _ Master Coder Protocol Documentation.pdf`

## 3) Modeling & Simulation (NASA‑grade Practices)

* **Paradigms:** Agent‑Based (ABM), Discrete‑Event (DES), System Dynamics (SD), Finite Element/Volume (FEM/FVM), and **Hybrid** models for multi‑scale systems.
* **V&V&C:** Verification, Validation, and Credibility—adopt NASA standards to ensure that simulations are correct, representative, and trustworthy.
* **Multi‑physics & Co‑simulation:** Functional Mock‑up Interface (FMI), multi‑tool coupling, and HPC considerations for aerospace‑grade workloads.

*File:*

* `Scientific Modeling and Simulation: A Comprehensive NASA-Grade Guide.pdf`

## 5) Chemistry & Biology (Foundations & SOPs)

* **Chemistry:** General, Organic, Inorganic, Physical chemistry references for materials, detectors, and cryo systems.
* **Biology:** Cell/Molecular biology, Genetics, Physiology—useful for analogies, statistical design, and lab SOP rigor.
* **SOPs:** Titrations, chromatography, and lab practices to harmonize experimental discipline across domains.

## 10) CI/CLI/Dashboard Integration

* **Docs in CI:**

  * Link‑check & spell‑check (`docs/`)
  * PDF existence checks for indexed items
  * Table‑of‑contents validation for this README
* **CLI Help Mapping:**

  * Keep CLI `--help` output synchronized with sections here via a generated index (optional `make docs-sync`).
* **Diagnostics Dashboard:**

  * Embed references from sections 2–9 into the HTML diagnostics report as “Learn More” links.
  * Generate a versioned `docs_index.json` consumed by the dashboard for quick lookups.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Add/Update Docs:** Place PDFs/MDs under `docs/` and update this README’s ToC/links.
2. **Run Lints:** `make docs-lint` (or `tox -e docs`) to validate links and formatting.
3. **Commit:** Use conventional commit style, e.g., `docs: add ARIEL pointing stability summary`.
4. **PR & CI:** CI enforces link checks and availability of all referenced files.

**Style:** Prefer concise, reference‑rich documents. Include revision dates and short abstracts at the top of each new doc. Keep filenames stable; use dashed or spaced names consistently.
