# SpectraMind V50 Logs

This folder stores runtime logs generated by the SpectraMind V50 pipeline.
Three formats are produced by the Hydra logging configuration:

1. **Rotating text logs** – `v50_pipeline.log` keeps human-readable records with automatic rotation to cap file size.
2. **JSONL event stream** – `v50_event_stream.jsonl` captures structured events for downstream analysis.
3. **Console output** – mirrored to standard output for immediate feedback.

Optional handlers can also sync events to MLflow or Weights & Biases when those integrations are enabled.

These files are ignored by git; the `.gitkeep` and this README preserve the directory structure.
