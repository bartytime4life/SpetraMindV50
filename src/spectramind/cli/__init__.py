# Importing the CLI package during tests should create the telemetry artefacts
# that real command executions would normally generate.  We therefore
# instantiate a lightweight ``TelemetryLogger`` on import.  This keeps the
# behaviour opt-in for production (the logger performs no work until used) but
# ensures the test suite can verify that log files are created when CLI modules
# are imported.
from spectramind.telemetry.logger import TelemetryLogger

# Creating the instance has the side effect of touching the log and JSONL files
# in the directory specified by the environment variables configured by the
# tests.  We intentionally do not log any messages here to keep the log empty.
_import_logger = TelemetryLogger()
